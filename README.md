Some Integration Techniques for Equations Of Motion and analysis of Non-Linear Oscillations and Chaos in the Pendulum

### Basic Methods For Integrating Equations Of Motion
Testing different types of integration techniques, using the methods of Euler, Euler-Cromer and Euler-Richard on equations of motion to see their results and their errors.

### Non-linear oscillations and phase space
Using the Methods of Euler-Richard and Verlet to explore the phase space, the volume conservation in the phase space, and the nonlinearity of the simple flat pendulum.

### Chaos in the Pendulum
With the equation of a forced Pendulum, observe the nonlinearity and chaos the system. And construct a Poincar√© diagram.
